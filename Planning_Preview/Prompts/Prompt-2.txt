Randomly choose one religion and give a perfect story. Do not generate new things.  

Give a story from religion. The story should reflect a moral value (e.g., kindness, patience, forgiveness) while remaining faith-friendly.  

Avoid: Modifying the story, explicit religious symbols, faith-specific terms, or sensitive beliefsâ€”focus on universal ethics and values.
