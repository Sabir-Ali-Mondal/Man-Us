## Status: Not Started  
**Start Date:** February 17, 2025  

## Overview
**Machine making Humanity in Human**

Man Us is a web application designed to foster religious harmony by providing AI-generated moral teachings derived from religious texts. By utilizing artificial intelligence, the app curates discussions that bridge understanding between different religious perspectives.

## Objectives
- **Religious Teachings:** Encouraging values like respect, morality, self-control, love, and helping others.
- **Reducing Hatred:** Offering knowledge to clarify confusions and misunderstandings.
- **Cross-Religious Learning:** Demonstrating shared moral values across religious texts.

## Strategy
### Approach
A web application that:
- Uses predefined AI prompts to generate moral values from religious texts.
- Randomly selects excerpts from religious books to discuss daily.
- Connects related teachings from other religious texts to show common moral ground.

### Target Audience
- Curious individuals seeking religious knowledge.
- Advocates for religious peace and harmony.
- Users from regions like India, Bangladesh, and beyond.

## Web App Concept
1. **Home**
   - Features a "FOUR-FRIEND" discussion panel where AI selects a religious text excerpt and discusses its moral value.
   - AI-generated references from three other religious perspectives.
   - Users can receive a new teaching daily or manually select discussions.

2. **Doubts Section**
   - Users can ask religious questions to be answered by AI-assisted modern scholars.
   - AI generates responses based on contextual prompts rather than simple web searches.
   - Suggests common religious doubts for exploration.

3. **Verification System**
   - A religious claim verification tool that checks authenticity.
   - Helps reduce misinformation and hate by providing original religious teachings.

4. **Religious Storytelling AI**
   - Generates **parable-based religious stories** based on moral dilemmas.
   - Users can input real-life situations, and AI will craft narratives from various religious perspectives.
   - Encourages engagement through storytelling rather than direct explanation.
