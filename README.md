Target audience
* Any curious people . 
* Religious peace thinkers.

Till now plan | Web App Concept
1. Home
   * Default interface: FOUR-FRIEND discussion panel.
   * A religious text excerpt is randomly selected, and its moral value is discussed.
   * Three other "friends" from different religions provide matching references from their respective texts.
   * Users can receive a new teaching daily or manually select discussions as much as they want.
2. Doubts Section
   * Users can ask religious doubts to be solved by modern religious scholars (AI-assisted).
   * Unlike a simple web search, AI will generate responses using a customizable prompt that considers context.
   * AI also suggests common religious doubts for users to explore.
3. Verification System
   * A true/false religious data verifier to check the authenticity of religious claims.
   * Helps reduce misinformation and hate by providing original teachings.

4. **Religious Storytelling AI**  
- AI generates **parable-based religious stories** based on moral situations.  
- Users can **input real-life scenarios**, and AI will craft **wisdom-filled narratives** from different religious perspectives.  
- Encourages **engagement and learning** through storytelling rather than direct explanation.  


Note:
* No need for deep theological or faith-related explanations, as it may make people far from questioning.
* Gives cultural teachings while introducing other religious perspectives.
