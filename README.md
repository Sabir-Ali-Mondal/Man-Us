## Overview
**Machine Making Humanity in Human**

> **"The more you know, the quieter you become."**

## Objectives
### Religious Teaching
- **Respect, Helping, Morality, Self-Control, Love for all.**
- Spreading respect and bonding between humans by addressing confusion and misunderstandings.
- Reducing hatred through proper knowledge and moral guidance.

## Strategy
### Approach
- A **web app** that runs with **predefined prompts**.
- Prompts automatically customize randomly over religious book chapters to extract **moral values** using **Artificial Intelligence**.
- Shows **related teachings from other religious books** every day to provide comparative insights.

### Target Audience
- Any **curious individuals** interested in religious values and morality.
- **Religious peace thinkers** looking for common ground.
- **Countries of focus**: India, Bangladesh, and other regions with diverse religious communities.

## Web App Concept
### 1. Home
- **Default interface**: FOUR-FRIEND discussion panel.
- A **religious text excerpt** is randomly selected, and its **moral value** is discussed.
- Three other "friends" from **different religions** provide **matching references** from their respective texts.
- Users can receive a **new teaching daily** or manually select discussions as much as they want.

### 2. Doubts Section
- Users can **ask religious doubts**, which will be solved by **modern religious scholars (AI-assisted).**
- Unlike a simple web search, **AI generates responses** using a customizable **context-aware prompt**.
- AI also suggests **common religious doubts** for users to explore.

### 3. Verification System
- A **true/false religious data verifier** to check the authenticity of religious claims.
- Helps **reduce misinformation and hate** by providing **original teachings**.

### 4. Religious Storytelling AI
- AI generates **parable-based religious stories** based on moral situations.
- Users can **input real-life scenarios**, and AI will craft **wisdom-filled narratives** from different religious perspectives.
- Encourages **engagement and learning** through storytelling rather than direct explanation.

### Notes:
- No need for **deep theological** or **faith-based explanations**, as it may discourage open questioning.
- Provides **cultural teachings** while introducing other religious perspectives.
- "**The more you know, the quieter you become.**"
